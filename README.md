# Huffman Encode-Decode Project

This project implements Huffman coding for efficient data compression and decompression. 
Huffman coding is a widely used algorithm for lossless data compression. 
The project includes two main components: 
  1. Huffman encoding
  2. Huffman decoding.

Takes a file from user and encode it to a new file(the compressed one) and gets downloaded in user's system.
Now, to get the actual file upload the encoded file and decompress it, the new file will give the actual text written on the file;
